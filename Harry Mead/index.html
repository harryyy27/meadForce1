			<h2> Introduction </h2>
			<p> Welcome to my page! As you can already tell, I'm Harry. I studied mechanical engineering at the University of Leeds, I'm a passionate learner of virtually anything I can get my hands on and I'm a self-confessed glory hunter living in London. After
				University, I underwent a brief stint as a maths tutor and helped friends and customers alike to get the skills or qualifications they required to achieve their academic goals. I also helped my sister with some of the more demanding maths in her astrophysics
				course while I searched for my first engineering job. However, after spending a year in the building services industry, I'm now looking for new challenges in the digital world!

			<h2> Hobbies & Interests </h2>
			<p> After my post University cooldown period, my enthusiasm for just about everything conceivable shot through the roof as I tried to fill the educational void that was left behind. Now one of my biggest worries in life is that I wont live long enough
				in this universe to develop a decent understanding of it. So as you can imagine, learning and reading are now two of my favourite things. Subjects like mycology, economics, botany and politics have all suddenly become very interesting to me; probably
				helped by the fact that politics in recent years has been almost as good as game of thrones. I also love a challenge. I actively seek them; whether that be playing a game of chess, solving a codewars kata or learning something like the Fourier transform.
				I took apart my broken PC speakers recently and fixed them just for the sheer thrill of it.. they lasted about 3 weeks before they overheated but that's 3 weeks more life than they would have had! The satisfaction of completing a difficult task is
				always the best kind of satisfaction. Team games such as football or any sort of challenge that involves the bringing together of minds also appeal to me. At University, I relished the opportunity to help complete team tasks such as designing and
				building a waterwheel, an electronic buggy and several programming projects on Matlab and Labview. Other activities on my large list of current interests include martial arts, physics, electrical engineering, most sports, moaning about the state of
				the world, playing guitar really badly and eating abnormal amounts of food.

			<h2> Everything Must Code </h2>
			<p> The world is becoming an increasingly digital place with innovations such as blockchain, smart city initiatives and AI giving programming the potential to become a lifelong pursuit. Learning to code and building software can be done from the comfort
				of your own lounge! No investment is required but time and you can both benefit from and contribute towards the collective intelligence of the world's coding community as you develop. So when the world runs amok with autonomy and begins to look like
				something out of the minority report, I want to be contributing towards its development!

			<h2> Founders and Coders </h2>
			<p> Coding encompasses a broad spectrum of disciplines and can be used to achieve so many things. At the heart of it all is web design. A well marketed and constructed webpage can be the difference between someone using your services or somebody else's.
				It's the first representation of yourself that they'll see and could be the last. It's my hope to learn the skills required to leave a lasting impression through meticulous design. Kickstarting my porfolio via the founders and coders course is the
				best possible course of action I can take to achieve this. It's also a chance for me to become part of something a lot bigger than myself. Founders and coders have been nothing but accommodating and I love the friendly, communal and selfless vibe
				I get from everyone I meet there. It would be nice to join the F&C family and the larger coding community you're a part of. I must admit, I feel quite at home already!
				<br>
				<br> Some friends of mine were members of past F&C cohorts and recommended this course to me a few years back (while I was hellbent on making my Â£30000 university debt count for something). They are now their own bosses and have the freedom to pursue
				their ambitions which is something I wish to achieve for myself. Personally, my ultimate goal is to eventually combine coding and engineering. I studied both mechatronics and robotics at university and gained first hand of experience of how rewarding
				it can be to integrate the two. If you love what you do, you'll never have to work a day in your life!
